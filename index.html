      <p>"SELF DEVELOPMENT" uuhhh if i ever became what i have imagined myself. it would be one of the biggest achivement of my life and my imagination of my self is not that unrealistic.It is absolutetly under my limits and i have seen many people doing it.So, I think i can do it too sure they many of them have unfare advantages but its fine,we will do it anyways.
